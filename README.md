Introducing MNCT - Mobile Network Compatability Tracker

Every year thousands of travellers travel to different countries, and they constantly worry about the network compatibility of their devices. Every country has support to various network bands, which makes it difficult for some people to identify if their device is compatible with the available network or spend money on buying a new phone.

To ease this issue, we introduce our Mobile Network Compatibility Tracker (NMCT). It is very easy to NMCT. Just select your device brand and model and the country you hope to visit, and it will provide you with the required information regarding compatibility.

This project is open source, and any contribution to it would be appreciated. This project would also be part of HacktoberFest to help new students and budding developers to get some good experience of git and web development.

To contribute to this project:
* Fork the repository
* Create a new branch with your name
* Make changes and submit a pull request.

Every pull request will pass through a review system, and you'll also get some reviews to improve it further. 

I hope you will enjoy contributing to this project.
